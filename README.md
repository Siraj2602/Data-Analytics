# Data-Analytics Project
## Football player market value predictor and team recommender
Football is the most popular sport in the world, and thus there is no surprise that footballers earn a lot of money. The market value of the ones at the pinnacle hold a huge market value.<br>
With all teams not having a big budget, the ones with a smaller budget have to manage the finances and also should ensure the best team possible with those finances.<br>
### The aim of this project is to:
* Predict the market value of footballers given various attributes of them like age, team, overall rating and their market value from the years
before.
* Given the money allotted to buy players, recommend the best possible team .

Neural Network has been proven in the paper to be a good tool for building a decision support system for a football team manager.  There are some attributes that a football player may have which cannot be neglected when it comes to choosing a rightful player for a football team. This system has employed the idea of neural network in considering this large amount of attributes needed in secting the rightful player for a football team. The result generated from the system has shown that neural network technique can help the football managers in player selection for a football team.
