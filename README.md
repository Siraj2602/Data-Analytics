# Data-Analytics Project
## Football player market value predictor and team recommender
Football is the most popular sport in the world, and thus there is no surprise that footballers earn a lot of money. The market value of the ones at the pinnacle hold a huge market value.<br>
With all teams not having a big budget, the ones with a smaller budget have to manage the finances and also should ensure the best team possible with those finances.<br>
### The aim of this project is to:
* Predict the market value of footballers given various attributes of them like age, team, overall rating and their market value from the years
before.
* Given a particular team and formation, recommend a replacement to the team such that there is an improvement in the team.
