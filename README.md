# Data-Analytics Project
## Football player market value predictor and team recommender
Football is the most popular sport in the world, and thus there is no surprise that footballers earn a lot of money. The market value of the ones at the pinnacle hold a huge market value.<br>
With all teams not having a big budget, the ones with a smaller budget have to manage the finances and also should ensure the best team possible with those finances.<br>
### The aim of this project is to:
* Predict the market value of footballers given various attributes of them like age, team, overall rating and their market value from the years
before.
* Given the money allotted to buy players, recommend the best possible team .

<br>
The data used is the fifa dataset from the years 2015 to 2020 , courtesy Kaggle.
<br>
The repo has the following folders: <br>
* Code: Consists of the python and R files , run to obtain and analyze results<br>
* Papers: Consists of the papers referred relevant to the project<br>
* fifa-20-complete-player-dataset: This is the dataset folder. It has the all the data files used in the project<br> 
* Literature survey: Contains the literature survey document.<br>

=======
OLS is used which gives a general idea as to what features are significant.<br>
Data transformation is done such that residuals do not follow any pattern.<br>
An adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.97 is obtained, which leads to the initial belief that there is overfitting in this model.<br>

### What we plan to do in the future:

* Try other models which might provide a better result in predicting the market value, like, PCR,Ridge and Lasso Regression, ANN, etc.
* Recommend the best team with the funds available using techniques like collaborative filtering.
